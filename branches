The main branch stores the official release history, and the develop branch serves as an integration branch for features.
It's also convenient to tag all commits in the main branch with a version number.
Feature branches are created off the develop branch and merged back into it when complete. 
Release branches are created off the develop branch for final testing before merging into master for production.
Hotfix branches are created off the master branch to address critical production issues.
